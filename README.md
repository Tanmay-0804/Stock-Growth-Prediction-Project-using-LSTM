# Stock Prediction
Stock Growth Prediction project using various libraries in Python, such as yfinance, pandas, numpy, keras, and streamlit. This project aimed to analyze the stock data of a particular company and predict its future stock prices. The application displays the closing price of the chosen stock against time in a graphical format. It also provides additional details such as data description, 100-day Moving Average. The LSTM model used for prediction has been trained on historical data and can forecast the stock price trend for future periods. To achieve this, We have preprocessed the data by scaling it using the MinMaxScaler and split it into training and testing sets. We have used a deep neural network model trained using the Keras library to predict future stock prices.
