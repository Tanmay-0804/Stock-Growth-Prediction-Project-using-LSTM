Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on past stock prices and is capable of forecasting future prices for a given stock.
Introduction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging yet essential task for investors, traders, and financial analysts. Machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning models like LSTM, have shown promise in capturing complex patterns in stock price data and making accurate predictions.
